<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>t the Positronics lab, we have been investigating using robots to help prevent falls and to help reduce injuries when falls do occur. We initially pursued this research using multi-rigid body simulation to avoid possible harm to humans during experimentation.</p>

<p>One of the surprising discoveries of our early research was the lack of a publicly available, computationally fast, human model. To address this gap, we developed a 20-DOF rigid body model (shown below) based on Dempsterâ€™s research on human body anthropometry. That study provides effective link lengths, 3-DOF joint limits, relative masses, and center-of-mass positions for links. We plan to release the source code for this model so that it can be used by other researchers.

We next developed a series of scenarios to assess whether a mobile manipulator robot, the PR2, would be able to arrest the fall. Below is a video showing several trials of the humanoid falling alone, along with attempts by the robot to arrest the fall using one of these strategies:
