<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his video from Roxana Leontie shows our PR2 robot, <em>Pepe</em>, autonomously opening  a drawer. Uncertainty from sensing the drawer's position and imprecision in Pepe's movements can make it challenging to perform tasks like this autonomously.</p>

# Opening a drawer using the PR2
My latest research focuses on <span style="color: #262626;">kinematic model extraction through robotic interaction</span>. Once we have a model the robot uses it to perform actions.  Few snapshots of opening a drawer given a model are in these videos that present it in-situ and in simulation. Will update after publication.
