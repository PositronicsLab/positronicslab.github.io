<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">R</span>unning with a small quadruped</p>

Performed using: Pacer: locomotion planning and control for legged robots.

We can use this software to have the robot run while using:
joint error-feedback (PID) control (unilateral contact with friction)
inverse dynamics (unilateral contact with friction)
inverted pendulum error-feedback (PID) stabilization (compressive and frictional ground reaction forces)

The direction that the robot is heading is refined online.  The robot is running toward a waypoint 10 meters in front of the robots starting position.

Running at 0.5 m/s (1.1 mph):

Running at 1 – 1.5 m/s (2.2 - 3.3 mph):

Scaling the R. Links robot up to the size of Big Dog (Boston Dynamics) or HyQ (IIT)—both are roughly 1 meter in length— is equivalent to a 10 mph run.

Performed using **Pacer**.
