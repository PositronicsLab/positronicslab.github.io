### Our Mission

The Positronics Lab at The George Washington University investigates dynamic robotic simulation and legged robot locomotion toward our greater goal of getting robots to perform tasks faster and with greater dexterity than humans and animals.

Two tools that we use to conduct this research are multibody dynamics and simulation with contact and impact, for which we have written and maintain the open source libraries [Ravelin] and [Moby]. **Moby** focuses on fast and accurate 
solutions
using the established science of _verification_ (ensuring that a software
implementation matches the mathematical models) and _validation_ (ensuring
that the simulation matches qualitative aspects of physical systems as much
as possible). **We validate our simulations using real robots**, namely
quadrupeds and mobile manipulators.
